# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Remove the HP Partner First Silver certificate image from the Certifications section.

**Planned changes:**
- Remove the `<img>` element referencing the HP Partner First Silver certificate image from the Certifications component
- Ensure the partner tier label and the date "February 24, 2026" remain visible
- Adjust the Certifications section layout to display gracefully without the image

**User-visible outcome:** The Certifications section no longer shows the certificate image, but all text content (partner tier label and date) remains intact and the layout looks clean.
