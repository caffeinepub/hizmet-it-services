# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Remove the Certifications & Partnerships section entirely from the application.

**Planned changes:**
- Remove the Certifications component from App.tsx so it no longer renders on the page
- Remove the "Certifications & Partnerships" section heading and any related placeholder content
- Remove the navigation link to the certifications/partnerships section from the Header

**User-visible outcome:** The page displays only the Header, Hero, Services, Products, AMC, and Footer sections, with no trace of a Certifications & Partnerships section or its navigation link.
