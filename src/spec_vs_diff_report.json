  "summary": "The diff successfully implements all five requirements (REQ-19 through REQ-23). The Footer component has been modified to add all four business credentials (UDYAM Registration, GST Number, GeM Seller ID, and email) in a dedicated 'Business Credentials' section. All credentials are properly labeled and the email is implemented as a clickable mailto link. The existing footer content (address, phone numbers, business hours) remains intact and the new section maintains the professional aesthetic with consistent styling.",
